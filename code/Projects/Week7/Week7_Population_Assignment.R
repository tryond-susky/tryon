# (1) - Which species is most likely to be r-selected prey and which its primary predator? (2 pts)
  ##D.mendotae represented by the black line is most likely to be the r-selected prey with Linmncalanus represented by the orange line being the primary predator.

# What is one relationship the third species MIGHT have to the first two? (2 pts)
  ##The third species may have a commensalism relationship where the Bythotrephes benefits from the success of the other two speices but also continues do survive as the others flucutate.

#Now copy/paste in the Lotka-Volterra function, plotting script, and load the "deSolve" package from the tutorial:
  install.packages("deSolve")
  library(deSolve)
  
  LotVmod <- function (Time, State, Pars) {
      with(as.list(c(State, Pars)), {
        dx = x*(alpha - beta*y)
        dy = -y*(gamma - delta*x)
        return(list(c(dx, dy)))
      })
  }  
  Pars <- c(alpha = 2, beta = 0.5, gamma = .2, delta = .6) #This is the line we will change
  State <- c(x = 10, y = 10)#For now keep this the same.
  Time <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)#For now keep this the same.
  out <- as.data.frame(ode(func = LotVmod, y = State, parms = Pars, times = Time)) #This is the operation that creates the Lotka-Volterra model based on our specified parameters.
  matplot(out[,-1], type = "l", xlab = "time", ylab = "population")
  legend("topright", c("Rabid foxes", "Cute bunnies"), lty = c(1,2), col = c(1,2), box.lwd = 0)
    
    #how to get this set up keep getting error about out
    
# (2) - What do alpha, beta, gamma, and delta represent in this function? (4 pts)
##Alpha is the rate of prey population growth. 
##Beta is the rate of predation. 
##Gamma is the rate of prey consumption, aka population stability. 
##Delta is the rate of prey consumption, aka predator die-off
  
# (3) - By only changing values for alpha, beta, gamma, and/or delta
# change the default parameters of the L-V model to best approximate the relationship between Limncalanus and D.mendotae, assuming both plots are on the same time scale.
# What are the changes you've made to alpha, beta, gamma, and delta from the default values; and what do they say in a relative sense about the plankton data? (4 pts)
# Are there other paramenter changes that could have created the same end result? (2 pts)
# Export your final L-V plot with a legend that includes the appropriate genus and/or species name as if the model results were the real plankton data, 
# and upload with your script. (hint - remember which one is the predator and which is the prey)
