# First create models with the same (y) and method (GLMM) as the published paper, using the GLMM function from the tutorial. 
  #Create two different models using the same 3 predictor (x) variables from the dataset. (4 points each) 
    # In one model only include additive effects.
# In the other model include one interactive effect.
# Use a binomial distribution and block as a random effect in both models to match the paper's analyses. Remember ?family to find distribution names.

# The authors used proportional consumption of prey as the (y) in their model, but did not include this in the dataset.
  # So we are going to create it - run the following line, assuming df= your data frame (feel free to change that):
df$prop.cons <- df$eaten/df$prey 

# (Q1) - The code in line 8 is performing two operations at once. What are they? (2 pts)


# (Q2) - Did the interactive effect change which variables predict proportional consumption? How, specifically, did the results change? (5 pts)


# (Q3) - Plot the residuals of both models. Do you think either model is a good fit? Why or why not? (3 pts)


# Re-run both models as generalized additive models instead (using gam). Then compare the AIC of both models. (4 points each)


# (Q4) - Which model is a better fit? (2 pt)


# (Q5) - Based on the residuals of your generalized additive models, how confident are you in these results? (2 pts)
